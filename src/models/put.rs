/// Put : Used to add new content or to update existing content.  A new content object is created by populating the `value` field, the content-id in the content object must not be present (null).  A content object is updated by populating the `value` containing the correct content-id.  If the key for a content shall change (aka a rename), then use a `Delete` operation using the current (old) key and a `Put` operation using the new key with the `value` having the correct content-id. Both operations must happen in the same commit.  A content object can be replaced (think: `DROP TABLE xyz` + `CREATE TABLE xyz`) with a `Delete` operation and a `Put` operation for a content using a `value`representing a new content object, so without a content-id, in the same commit.
